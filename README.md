## üíª Technologies

- This application is created with **[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)**

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** _(v18)_

- Styling syntax was written in pure CSS

## Challenges

- First, I used the WeatherStack API to fetch the weather data. Then when I deployed the site I noiced that the free version of WeatherStack api didn't come with https and so the api calls were been blocked by content-type security policy. Therefore I had to switch to OpenWeather API, which came with more api calls per month and https header in the api url.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add documentation for components using **Storybook**

- [ ] Publish this project as an NPM package that can be consumed elsewhere.
